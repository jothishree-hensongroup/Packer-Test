# Work in progress!

Intended for a baseline CSM / CAM ready image. 

We intend to move in prereqs from the deployment automation 
to packer. There may be times when new versions require new things 
and the image maintenance may tail the updates, in that case 
deployment automation will temporarily take over until
we update the base images.
